                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    This was a 5 person project developed over 5 weeks for a course called Interactive Arts.
                     The task was to develop an interactive art installation. This piece is called Invisible 
                     Touch. I took on a leadership role, I proposed the idea and worked as the main project director.

                <h3>Process</h3>
                <p>
                    Invisible Touch was inspired by <span class="italic">Telematic Dreaming</span> (1992) by Paul Sermon. 
                    Below are some of the first sketches I drew of the concept. The installation uses
                     two cameras and two projectors that display the camera's live footage. The projector
                      displays are overlapped such that, when people put their hands in front of the two
                       separate cameras, the display will show them touching. You can see this shown 
                       roughly in the left sketch, and on the right is an initial drawing of the camera box setup.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To test the technology for the project, we rented out all the necessary equipment from the library.
                     We connected the cameras to the projectors and got the projector images to overlap by simply 
                     stacking the projectors on top of one another.
                </p>

                <p>
                    There were a few things that we changed in the following test. I learned more about 
                    the camera settings to turn off any interface displays (white boxes, text). We also 
                    rented bigger projectors and a proper projector screen, and constructed our black boxes
                     for people to put their hands into. This allowed us to see something akin to what our final
                      product would actually look like. 
                </p>

                    Below are some installation diagrams to better illustrate the final setup, and some pictures of the final installation.

                <h3>Reflection</h3>
                <p>
                    Invisible Touch is a conceptual piece about space and the human body. While participantsâ€™ 
                    images may touch, they physically remain separated in space in their respective boxes. 
                    By isolating your body into one of these boxes in order to connect digitally, Invisible 
                    Touch explores the extent to which digitally-mediated closeness is possible, and what 
                    closeness can feel like in these spaces. Be it the growing normality of technology or a 
                    pandemic-induced necessity for it, the conversation of digital closeness is more relevant than ever. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    While this project definitely does reach broader universal themes, it carries a lot of 
                    meaning to me on a personal level too. As a trans person, I think this piece explains 
                    something about my emotional disconnect with my body and my desire to connect with people
                     and feel present in those experiences.
